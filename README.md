# Who I am
- Backend developer
- Experimenter
- Guy who definitely spends to much time in front of computers
- Wrote my "hello world" piece of software in 1998
- Earned my first money on software development in 2003
- Master's degree in computer science received in 2009
- Worked remotely for companies based in Poland, Finland, Ireland, Israel and USA

# What I work on
I am a software engineer developing [Coreum blockchain](https://go.exw.co/coreum).

# My hobby projects

## PBFT blockchain engine
I develop a set of projects implementing my idea iof pBFT-based blockchain. It's not backed by any VC, for now it's just a sandbox for my experiments.
I found that it is possible to develop much more performant engine that one delivered by CometBFT+Cosmos SDK. I assume it should be possible to process
~10k transactions per second, ensuring immediate finality. Here are the GitHub repositories being parts of this project:
- [Spin](https://go.exw.co/spin) - implementation of circle buffer
- [Photon](https://go.exw.co/photon) - library instantly converting structures to their in-memory binary representation
- [Proton](https://go.exw.co/proton) - super-efficient data (de)serializer
- [Entanglement](https://go.exw.co/entanglement) - message sharing in mesh network
- [Fusion](https://go.exw.co/fusion) - transaction executor
- [Storm](https://go.exw.co/storm) - key-value store supporting merkle-proofs and snapshots

## OSMan
[OSMan](https://go.exw.co/osman) - tool for building Linux images used to boot my computers, servers and virtual machines.
It is a weird stuff connecting ZFS, QEMU, linux containers and initramfs to provide a reliable way to build and boot all my operating systems.
It is a docker-like tool, but for entire operating systems, allowing me to boot whatever I need, whenever I need, managing required resources (CPU, memory, disks, IP addresses).
You may treat it as my local, private cloud of bare metal machines.

# Most interesting projects I've been involved in
- Developing software managing cloud services on high scale: virtual machines, networking, kubernetes clusters, docker containers, operating systems etc.
- AI for predicting cancer metastatic disease
- Developing Layer-1 blockchains
- AI for semen evaluation
- AI for cancer detection based on histopathological slides

# My infrastructure
To work effectively on advanced projects I manage my own infrastructure:
- Direct private 10 Gbps fiber connection to local data center
- 1 Gbps Internet link
- Public IP pool
- Networking equipment and redundant links, including 3 independent network connections
- Servers
- GPUs
- As much storage as needed
- Backups in place
Whenever I work on a project requiring something special, no matter if it's hardware, software or networking,
I have an environment ready to be extended at any time.
